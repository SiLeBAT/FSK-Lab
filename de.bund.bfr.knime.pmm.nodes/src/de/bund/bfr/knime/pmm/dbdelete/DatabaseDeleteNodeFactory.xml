    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            Deletes test conditions and fitted primary and secondary models from the database.<br></br>
            To be able to delete test conditions, for example, load these with the Data Reader node, attach the DB Data Deleter and tick "Delete test conditions?".<br></br>
            If not all test conditions in the database need to be deleted, place a Data Selection node between the Data Reader and the DB data Deleter. All selected test conditions will be deleted.<br></br>
            To <u>delete</u> primary and secondary models as well as test conditions <u>all at once</u> load them with a Model Reader (Level: Combined Primary/Secondary). Attach the DB Data Deleter, tick all boxes and execute. <br></br>
            <u>It is not possible to delete a primary model, if a secondary model is dependent on it.</u> In this case the secondary model needs to be deleted first (or together with the primary model).
