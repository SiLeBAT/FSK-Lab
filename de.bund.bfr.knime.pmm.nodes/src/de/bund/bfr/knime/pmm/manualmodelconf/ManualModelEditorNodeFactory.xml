    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node is designed to add information to previously estimated primary and / or secondary models or to correct details. References can be added and a subjective quality score can be given.</intro>
        
        <option name="Model type">Define type of model: Primary, secondary or primary (secondary). The latter is a combination of one primary and one or more secondary models.</option>
        <option name="Formula from DB">Choose one of the formulas from the internal database if the aim is to create a variation of a stored formula. To enter a completely new formula do not change this field.</option>
        <option name="Formula name">Enter a name for the new formula.</option>
        <option name="Type">Choose the type of the model (e.g. inactivation in case of a primary model or T if a secondary model models the change of a parameter depending on the temperature.</option>
        <option name="Formula">Enter the formula and click 'Apply'. Enter e.g. '2x' as '2*x', if '2' does not belong to the parameter name. Brackets may not be used left of the equals sign: "N(t) = a*(b+c)" -> "N = a*(b+c)".</option>
        <option name="Parameter Definition">Define the independent parameter. If known, also enter value, standard error, minimum and maximum values for the parameter. If the option 'primary (secondary)' was chosen click on a parameter name in order to define the secondary model for this parameter.</option>
        <option name="Model Name">Enter an informative name, e.g. 'E coli in culture medium at 30 C.</option>
        <option name="Goodness of fit">If known from a previously estimated model (e.g. from the literature), enter values for R<sup>2</sup>, root mean square (RMS), Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC).</option>
        <option name="References">The reference for the mathematical formula can be added, edited or deleted. The new reference can be chosen from the internal database. If the reference is not yet in there click the '+' button to manually enter a new reference.</option>
