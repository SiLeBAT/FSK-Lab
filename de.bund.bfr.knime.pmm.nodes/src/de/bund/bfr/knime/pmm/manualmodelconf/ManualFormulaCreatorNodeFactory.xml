        <intro>Enter primary and / or secondary model formulas.</intro>
        
        <option name="Model type">Define type of model: Primary, secondary or primary (secondary). The latter is a combination of one primary and one or more secondary model formulas.</option>
        <option name="Formula from DB">Choose one of the formulas from the internal database if the aim is to create a variation of a stored formula. To enter a completely new formula do not change this field.</option>
        <option name="Formula name">Enter a name for the new formula.</option>
        <option name="Type">Choose the type of the model (e.g. inactivation in case of a primary model or T if a secondary model models the change of a parameter depending on the temperature.</option>
        <option name="Formula">Enter the equation starting with 'y=', for example. When the equation is complete click 'Apply'. Enter '2x' as '2*x' to multiply; else '2x' is one parameter. Brackets may not be used left of the equals sign: "N(t) = ..." should be written as "Nt = ..." or simply "N=...".</option>
        <option name="Parameter Definition">Define the independent parameter. If known, also enter minimum and maximum values for the parameter and a description. If the option 'primary (secondary)' was chosen click on a parameter name in order to define the secondary model for this parameter.</option>
        <option name="References">The reference for the mathematical formula can be added, edited or deleted. The new reference can be chosen from the internal database. If the reference is not yet in there click the '+' button to manually enter a new reference.</option>
