      <h4>Installing R with bundles</h4>
      <p>For convenience some bundles with preconfigured R are included in the software site. You can pick either the 32 or 64 bit version depending of your operating system. If you already have R installed on your system and you prefere to use that version, do not check either of the options. The bundles are named:
        <ul>
          <li>R 3.4.4 for 64-bit Windows</li>
          <li>R 3.4.4 for 32-bit Windows</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Installing R manually</h4>
      <p>If R is already installed it can be configured to be used in FSK-Lab. First two R packages need to be installed. These can be easily installed in an R console with the command: <code>install.packages(c('Rserve', 'miniCRAN','svglite'))</code>.
      </p>
      <p>The path to R needs to be set in Preferences, FSK-Lab settings.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fsk-mac">
      <p>On Mac it is necessary to install R 3.4.x from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/</a>. FSK-Lab on Mac requires three packages: Rserve, miniCRAN and Cairo. These may be installed in the R console with: <code>install.packages(c('Rserve', 'miniCRAN', 'Cairo'))</code>. Besides these three packages, MacOS also requires the XQuartz software which can be obtained at <a href="http://xquartz.macos-forge.org">http://xquartz.macos-forge.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The path to the R folder to be entered in KNIME (as described for Windows) should be /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/.

      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="fsk-ubuntu">
      <p>
        First, Ubuntu requires some development libraries for the R packages that can be installed with apt-get in the terminal:
        <code>sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        On Mac it is necessary to install the packages Rserve and miniCRAN that can be installed in the R terminal with:
        <code>install.packages(c('Rserve', 'miniCRAN'))</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The path to the R folder to be entered in KNIME should be: /usr/lib/R.

# Recommended optimization of KNIME
{% include warning.html title="Warning" content="A bad configuration can break KNIME and this is only recommended for expert users" %}

The configuration file *KNIME.ini* allows to optimize KNIME. To apply the changes KNIME must be started after saving the changes to this file.

1. The amount of RAM available in KNIME might be extended by changing the value of `-Xmx`. For example `-Xmx4g` indicates that 4GB RAM should be used.
2. If the connection to a KNIME server through KNIME fails, it might help to increase the response time. Simply add the line `-Dcom.knime.enterprise.client.connect-timeout=10000`.
