    <shortDescription>
        View models and predicted microbial concentrations
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>View models as a graph. Define time steps to obtain a prediction on microbial concentrations according to the selected estimated model.</intro>
		
		<option name="Graph">Visualizes models and the predicted concentrations over time.<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Mouse zoom:</b> To view a part of the graph in detail left click and simultaneously drag the mouse right and down. Another way is to use the zoom options in the context menu.<br></br><br></br>
        <b>Context Menu</b> (Right click in the graph):<br></br>
        <u>Properties:</u> Change font (type, size, color) and labels as well as the appearance of the graph. These changes are lost as soon as the options dialog is closed. To save a graph with changed properties (e.g. for a publication) use the "Save as..." option in the context menu.<br></br>
        <u>Copy:</u> Copies the graph to the clipboard enabling you to paste it in a graphical editor.<br></br>
        <u>Save as...:</u> Saves the graph as PNG (a bitmap image) or as SVG (a vector image). Compared to the PNG image in the outport (which has a resolution of 640x480 pixels) this PNG is saved with the same size as on the screen.<br></br>
        <u>Print:</u> Print the graph directly from Knime PMM-Lab.<br></br>
        <u>Zoom:</u> Zoom in and out or auto range the view for one or both axes.</option>
        
        <option name="Display Options">
        <u>Draw Lines:</u> No function<br></br> 
        <u>Display Highlighted Row:</u> If checked, only the highlighted row in the left table is displayed. A comfortable way to select sets of data is to highlight a row and then navigate with the arrow keys (up/down) through the table. Using the keyboard, the space bar can be used to select/unselect a set of data.<br></br>
        <u>Show Legend:</u> Display the parameter name together with symbol and color.<br></br>
        <u>Add Info in Legend:</u> No function<br></br>
        <u>Export as SVG:</u> If checked, the graph outport contains a SVG file and not a PNG file after execution of the node.</option>
                      
        <option name="Range">Check the box to set the minimum and maximum values for x and y axes.</option>
        
        <option name="Variables on Display"><u>X and Y:</u> Displays the heading of the displayed data column. Changing units automatically reformats the axes.<br></br>
        <u>X/Y Transform:</u> Transforms the data on the X/Y axis (square root, ln, log10, basis e, basis 10). This is useful if a display of data other than the PMM-Lab default (log10) is wished for (e.g. as actual cell counts -> 10^).<br></br>
        <u>X/Y Change Init/Lag Params:</u> Define the parameters for the initial concentration and the lag phase.</option>
        
        <option name="Other Variables">If a parameter is dependent on more than one environmental condition (e.g. temperature and pH-value), values can be adjusted here by changing the position of the slider or by entering a number into the textbox.</option>
        
        <option name="Filter">Filter the rows in the table to be displayed for the model estimation status:<br></br>
        <i>Ok</i> = fitting successful;<br></br>
        <i>No Covariance Matrix</i> = Confidence intervals cannot be calculated. Editing the expert settings in the Model Fitting node or choosing a different formula may help;<br></br>
        <i>Coeff out of limit</i> = The fitting was successful, but only because the minimum/maximum values of the parameters given in the model formula were ignored;<br></br>
        <i>Failed</i> = Fitting was not successful. Editing the expert settings in the Model Fitting node or choosing a different formula may help.</option>
        
        <option name="Select">Either select all sets of data, unselect chosen data sets or invert the current selection.</option>
        
        <option name="Columns">Click on <u>'Customize'</u> to select the columns to be displayed, e.g. model name, quality criteria (R<sup>2</sup>, AIC) and assay conditions (temperature, pH, a<sub>W</sub>).<br></br>
        <u>'Set optimal width'</u> changes the width of the columns such that the whole text is visible in each cell.</option>
        
        <option name="Left Table">The table shows the available sets of data, whether they are currently being displayed (selected), the color and shape of the symbol and other information (see "Columns"). Clicking on a column header sorts the rows. To change the order of the columns drag the column headline. This is temporarily and not saved when the node dialog is closed.</option>
        <option name="Right Table">Time values can be entered into the first column. For these times microbial concentrations are predicted according to the estimated model(s) chosen in the left table. Results can be entered into spreadsheets and text files via copy and paste.<br></br><u>Set equidistant steps</u> facilitates the entry of evenly distributed values. To get a prediction for the inactivation of a bacterium during 15 seconds of pasteurization, for example, enter 'Number of Steps' = 15 and 'Step Size' = 1. The time unit is the same as on the x-axis in the graph and can be changed in the 'Variables on Display' section. If 'Inverse' is checked, concentration values can be entered and the software tries to find the corresponding time value.</option>
