Anderson, the editor of the Little Review.  The review published first works by Sherwood Anderson, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, and Ezra Pound.  This research draws upon mostly primary sources including memoirs, published letters, and a complete collection of the Little Review. Most prior research on Anderson focuses on her connection to the famous writers and personalities that she published and associated with.  This focus undermines her role as the dominant creative force behind one of the most influential little magazines published in the 20th Century. This case example shows how little magazine publishing is arguably a literary art"},{"isReferenceDescription":true,"date":"1905-07-06","doi":"10.1002/zenodo.211137","authorList":"James Bond, Timothy Dalton","title":"Norwalk virus: How infectious is it?","volume":"0","issue":"0","status":"Legal","website":"www.sciencemag.org","abstract":"This project involves discovering how the American Revolution was remembered during the nineteenth century.  The goal is to show that the American Revolution was memorialized by the actions of the United States government during the 1800s. This has been done by examining events such as the Supreme Court cases of John Marshall and the Nullification Crisis. Upon examination of these events, it becomes clear that John Marshall and John Calhoun (creator of the Doctrine of Nullification) attempted to use the American Revolution to bolster their claims by citing speeches from Founding Fathers. Through showing that the American Revolution lives on in memory, this research highlights the importance of the revolution in shaping the actions of the United States government."},{"isReferenceDescription":true,"publicationType":"DICT","date":"1905-07-07","doi":"10.1111/j.153xxx924.1999.tb01143.x","authorList":"Jack Ryan, Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford","title":"Dose Response Models For Infectious Gastronomies","volume":"0","issue":"0","status":"Peer reviewed","website":"http://www.techbriefs.com","abstract":"The purpose of this research is to identify a subtype of autism called Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia (DVD).  DVD is a motor-speech problem, disabling oral-motor movements needed for speaking. The first phase of the project involves a screening interview where we identify DVD and Non-DVD kids.  We also use home videos to validate answers on the screening interview.  The final phase involves home visits where we use several assessments to confirm the child’s diagnosis and examine the connection between manual and oral motor challenges. By identifying DVD as a subtype of Autism, we will eliminate the assumption that all Autistics have the same characteristics. This will allow for more individual consideration of Autistic people and may direct future research on the genetic factors in autism."}],"language":"English","software":"R","languageWrittenIn":"R 3","modelCategory":{"modelClass":"Dose-response model","modelSubClass":[],"modelClassComment":"This Model Class is very special"},"status":"Uncurated","objective":"Objective is to test, whether all metadata are displayed correctly","description":"description of a system using mathematical concepts and language.
